# Crypto-Classification

This project was created for the class CS 4501: Statistical Learning and Graphical Models. I aim to see if daily price change in Bitcoin can be predicted by historic pubilc sentiment as measured from Twitter data. Specifically, will the average number of likes and hashtags per tweet including 'Bitcoin' or '$BTC'.

## Introduction

In stock market investing, the Efficient Market Hypothess states that markets are efficient to an extent that investment strategies are futile in making gains beyond where the overall market moves. Cryptocurrency markets have significantly less data and their efficiency is less tested. This project aims to challenge the efficiency of the Bitcoin market by testing its predictability, specifically, using public sentiment on social media as a predictor. *Can daily price changes in Bitcoin be predicted by twitter sentiment from the previous day?*
